        <h1>Super G-string theory</h1>
        <p>
            In basic string theory, the fundamental object is the 1d string.
            It vibrates in different modes, the different vibrations giving rise to various quantum properties. 
            But string theory has a variety of problems: it implies 10 (or 11, but not 12 for obvious reasons) spacetime dimensions, and it does not seem to have a unique vacuum.
        </p>
        <p>
            To address these problems, the renowned string theorist <a href="http://insti.physics.sunysb.edu/~siegel/">Warren Siegel</a> with collaborators, has proposed a novel approach to quantum gravity, named super G-string theory. As they say in their not too abstract, 
            <q>We describe a new string theory which gives all the phenomenology anybody could or will ever want (and more). It makes use of higher dimensions, higher derivatives, higher spin, higher twist, and hierarchy. It cures the problems of renormalizability of gravity, the cosmological constant, grand unification, supersymmetry breaking, and the common cold.
            </q>
            this theory has a lot of nice benefits. The G-String theory of quantum physics speculates that everything in the universe is fundamentally based on the posterior motions of the Homo Sapien female, which produces quantum vibration. While quantum theoreticians work on hopelessly intangible problems, such as why gravity is weaker than the electromagnetic force, G-String theorists focus on tangible realities like the proportion of mammalian protuberances to the experienced dimensional endowment of the viewer.
