        <h1>Anti de Sitter space</h1>

        <p>
            Anti-de Sitter space is just the space in which distance between different points is defined differently from our usual Minkowski space. On the picture here you can see the famous print by Dutch artist M. C. Escher, which visualise the tessellation of an AdS-like space by triangles and squares. All triangles and squares are of equal size if we take into account a proper definition of distance between points.The important fact about d-dimensional AdS space is that it has a boundary and this boundary is (d-1)-dimensional Minkowski space.

            <p>
            To summarize, the original statement of AdS/CFT duality was considering string theory living in 5-dimensional AdS space and a particular 4-dimensional theory living on the boundary of AdS-space â€“ in our usual 4-dimensional world. However during the last decade there was huge progress in the area and in our days people have constructed similar dualities for many different supersymmetric, conformal theories.

        <h1>Conformal field theory</h1>

        <p>
            In quantum field theory, scale invariance is a common and natural symmetry, because any fixed point of the renormalization group is by definition scale invariant. Conformal symmetry is stronger than scale invariance, and one needs additional assumptions to argue that it should appear in nature. The basic idea behind its plausibility is that local scale invariant theories have their currents given by is a Killing vector. 
            Under some assumptions it is possible to completely rule out this type of non-renormalization and hence prove that scale invariance implies conformal invariance in a quantum field theory, for example in unitary compact conformal field theories in two dimensions.
            While it is possible for a quantum field theory to be scale invariant but not conformally invariant, examples are rare. For this reason, the terms are often used interchangeably in the context of quantum field theory.
